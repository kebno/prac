# 013 Array Processing, Visualized

## Initial Plan
  * Demonstrate the structure of the cross-spectral density
    matrix.
    - Plot representations of CSDM to match points on Fig 2 of "Robust Adaptive
      Beamforming", (rows of these figures for each example)
    - Knob to adjust look direction
    - Knob to adjust number of elements, element spacing
      - Plot of CSDM angle, magnitude
      - Plot beamformer output
      - Plot directivity of array (spherically isotropic noise)
