# 006 Phaser game framework Hello World

## The Phaser docs quickstart
* Clone the [Phaser repo](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)
* Clone the [Phaser example repo](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples)
* Download their hello world zip file.
* Unzip it
* Start up the Python SimpleHTTPServer in the project root dir
* Go to the proper url in a browser
* Magic (no really, the examples are amazing!)

## Progress on this effort
1. Create own interactive page with Phaser. The mouse controls the direction
   of the "signal".  Currently this is just an arrow constrained around a circle.
1. Was meant to be start of interactive demonstration of delay and sum
   beamforming.
1. Will consider this at a later date when I pick back up the browser
   based beamforming dashboard visualization plan.
