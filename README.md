practice programming often

And it is because I know the difficulty, it is because I 
know the almost disastrous effect of failure in such an
enterprise, that I earnestly advise a very humble beginning. 
You must safeguard your self-respect. Self-respect is at the 
root of all purposefulness, and a failure in an enterprise 
deliberately planned deals a desperate wound at one's
self-respect.  Hence I iterate and reiterate: Start quietly,
unostentatiously. --- Arnold Bennett


### Understanding the code

Unless stated, defaults are always used.  You should be able to understand
and/or reproduce what I did by looking at the documentation for the
packages, modules, and programs used in these exercises. If there is a fancy
trick not in the documentation, I will state where I found it.

The names of the exercises may not fully describe the features. Refer
to the individual README's for specific details.
