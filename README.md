### Understanding the code

Unless stated, defaults are always used.  You should be able to understand
and/or reproduce what I did by looking at the documentation for the
packages, modules, and programs used in these exercises. If there is a fancy
trick not in the documentation, I will state where I found it.

The names of the exercises may not fully describe the features. Refer
to the individual README's for specific details.
